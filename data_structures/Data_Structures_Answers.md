Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
> O(n) because size of the stack grows proportionally to the number of nodes.
2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
> O(n) because the number of operations grows proportionally to the number of nodes.
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
> O(n) because the number of operations grows proportionally the number of nodes
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
> O(n) because the size of the queue will grow proportionally to the number of nodes
5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
> Not sure on this one, but since we have go through every node to sort, it's O(n)
6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
> O(n) since the array result grows as n grows.
